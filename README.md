    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    
    <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl
        of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are
        kept as pets or for cockfighting.</p>
    
    <p>
        Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are
        numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>
